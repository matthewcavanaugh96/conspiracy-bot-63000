Ideas and Issues

ISSUE
GitHub warned me about my OpenAI key. Is this any danger? Should I instead have it reference a text file stored outside my repository?

QUESTION - Not a flaw but maybe an aesthetic choice
To save space on screen, should my "facts list" reference a separate text file?

IDEA
Build a dataframe that compiles instructions, questions, and responses for each run. May make sense to do this on a separate notebook.
