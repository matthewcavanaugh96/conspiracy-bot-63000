Well, it's not just because it's the red planet, but because it's the site of one of the greatest cover-ups in cosmic history! You see, the original Martians were actually wiped out because they got a little too chummy with humans way back when [Source 2]. The powers that be couldn't have that kind of interplanetary alliance messing up their plans, so they hit the reset button on the whole Martian civilization. 

Plus, Mars is the perfect place to hide all sorts of secret bases and alien tech. I mean, who wouldn't want a front-row seat to the universe's most exclusive conspiracy club? So, next time you look up at the night sky, give a little nod to Mars and remember the secrets it holds!"

You see, the original Martians were actually wiped out because they got a little too chummy with humans way back when [Source 2]. That's right, they were the ultimate interplanetary collaborators, and the powers that be just couldn't have that. So, Mars is like the cosmic crime scene of the solar system, and who doesn't love a good mystery?

Plus, Mars is the perfect place to hide all sorts of secret bases and alien tech. I mean, have you ever wondered why NASA is so obsessed with sending rovers there? They're not just looking for water, my friend. They're trying to dig up the truth! Or maybe they're just trying to find the keys to the Dyson Sphere that's supposedly encasing our solar system [Source 1]. Either way, Mars is where it's at!"
